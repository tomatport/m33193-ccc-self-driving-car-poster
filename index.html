				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					The aim of this poster is to demonstrate the process of designing an 'ethical engine' for a self driving car,
					utilising the concepts of graph theory, route finding algorithms, and applying ethical decision making to risk analysis.
				</p>

				<h2>Creating the Graph</h2>
				<!--
					image of the town, then image of simple graph
					this should include the distance weightings
				-->

				<p>
					The first step to creating the 'engine,' is to convert the layout of the town into a graph.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is achieved by creating a node for each intersection, and connecting them with edges that represent the roads between them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each edge is weighted according to the distance between the two nodes it connects.
					This was measured by calculating the distance between the two nodes in pixels. It was assumed that the image of the map was to scale.

				<h2>The Fastest Route</h2>
				<!-- 
					include psuedocode for dijkstra's or a* algorithm
					then show example of the fastest route
				-->
				<p>
					To calculate the fastest route, I decided to use Dijkstra's algorithm.
					This is a pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, and is simple enough to understand and work through by hand.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will assume that we will travel at a constant speed throughout, and that we should not go back on ourselves.
				</p>

				<h3>Explaining Dijkstra's</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						First, we assign a tentative distance to each node in the graph. This starts at 0 for the starting node, and infinity for all other nodes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Then, we select the node with the lowest tentative distance, and calculate the distance to each of its neighbours.
					</li>
					<li>
						If the distance to a neighbour is less than its current tentative distance, we update the tentative distance to the new, lower value.
					</li>
					<li>
						We then repeat steps 2 and 3 until we have visited all nodes in the graph.
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, we can trace back through the graph from the destination node, following the path of lowest tentative distance, to find the shortest path.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>The Fastest Route</h3>
				<p>
					Using the steps set out above, we can calculate the fastest route from the starting node to the destination node.
					In this case, the fastest route...

				<h2>Risk</h2>
				<!-- 
					This is where we add in risk analysis
					How do we calculate the risk?
					Show the least risky route
				-->

				<p>
					To calculate the risk of a route, we will need to assign a risk value to each edge in the graph.
					In this case, the map of the town is colour coded to show the risk of an area: red represents a busy area, where there is a high risk of an accident, and green represents a quiet area, where there is a low risk of an accident. Blue represents an area of medium risk.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are many considerations to take into account when deciding how to assign a risk value to each edge:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>I have chosen to take the utilitarian approach of maximising the total happiness of the passengers and pedestrians when assigning risk values.</li>
					<li>Each colour recieves a value, i.e: red = 3, blue = 2, green = 1. If a node is on the border of two colours, the highest risk value will be used, to maximise the safetey (and therefore happiness) of both the passengers and pedestrians.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Combining Risk &amp; Speed</h2>
				<!-- 
					How do we combine the two?
					We need to find a way to combine the two, so that we can find the best route
					How much risk are we willing to take to get to our destination faster?
					How much time are we willing to spend to get to our destination safer?

				<h2>Testing on a New Town</h2>
				<!-- 
					We need to test our algorithm on a new town
					What is the best route taking into account risk and speed?
					We can demonstrate the aforementioned suggestions here
