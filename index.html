				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					The aim of this poster is to demonstrate the process of designing an 'ethical engine' for a self driving car,
					utilising the concepts of graph theory, route finding algorithms, and applying ethical decision making to risk analysis.
				</p>

				<h2>Creating the Graph</h2>
				<!--
					image of the town, then image of simple graph
					this should include the distance weightings
				-->

				<ol>
					<li>
						We must convert the map of the town into a graph
					</li>
					<li>
						Each intersection is translated into a node, and each road is translated into an edge
					</li>
					<li>
						The distance of each road is used as the weight of each edge
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>The Fastest Route</h2>
				<!-- 
					include psuedocode for dijkstra's or a* algorithm
					then show example of the fastest route
				-->
				<ol>
					<li>
						A* is popular, efficient, and easy to understand.
					</li>
					<li>
						It may not always find the fastest route like Dijkstra's algorithm, is more efficient.
					</li>
					<li>
						Our heuristic function is the straight-line distance to the destination node.
					</li>
					<li>
						We assume a constant speed, with no backtracking. A more robust implementation would take into account speed limits and other factors.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Stepping Through A*</h3>
				<p>
					TODO: There should be a slideshow of images showing the steps, in diagram and table form - with captions

				<h2>Factoring in Risk</h2>
				<!-- 
					This is where we add in risk analysis
					How do we calculate the risk?
					Show the least risky route
				-->

				<ol>
					<li>
						To factor in the risk of the route, we can use the busyness of the areas on the map. We can assume that the busier an area is, the more likely it is that an accident will take place.
					</li>
					<li>
						We can assign a risk value to each area, and take the risk of the most dangerous area that the road borders. This is a utilitarianist approach, as it maximises the safety of the passengers and pedestrians using an objective method. 
					</li>
					<li>
						An algorithm is unable to subscribe to deontological principles, as it is unable to make moral judgements. Defining deontological rules for the car to follow is infeasible, as it would be impossible to account for every possible scenario, and the ethics of every situation are inherently subjective. Virtue ethics would also require the car to have a 'moral compass,' which is not possible.
					</li>
					<li>
						We can convert the risk of each road into a numerical value, to use as a multiplier in the graph. The weight of each edge (road) on the graph is multiplied by the risk of the road, to give a new weight that takes into account both distance and risk. This new weight is then used by the A* algorithm to calculate the route.
					</li>
					<li>
						The multipliers can be adjusted to prioritise risk over distance, or vice versa. For example, an emergency service vehicle would prioritise speed over safety, and therefore the risk multipliers would be lowered to prioritise distance. Other vehicles, such as a lorry carrying hazardous materials, or a coach full of passengers, would prioritise safety over speed, and therefore the risk multipliers would be increased to prioritise risk.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</section>

			<section style="grid-area: five">
				<h2>The Optimal Route</h2>
				<p>
					Now that we have a method of combining distance and risk into one value, we can use this to calculate the optimal route, using the same A* algorithm as previous.
				</p>

				<!-- TODO: what are appropriate risk multipliers? -->
				<!-- maybe we could have an interactive demo with a slider to adjust the risk multipliers? -->
				<p>
					In this example, the risk multipliers were set to X, Y, and Z for the green, blue, and red areas respectively. This means that the risk of a road is multiplied by 2 if it borders a red area, 1.5 if it borders a blue area, and 1 if it borders a green area. This was found to be a good balance between speed and safety. The risk multipliers can be adjusted to prioritise speed or safety, as discussed in the previous section.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section style="grid-area: six">
				<h2>Testing on New Towns</h2>
				<!-- 
					We need to test our algorithm on a new town
				-->

				<p>
					Now that the algorithm has been tested on the initial town, we can ensure its generalisability by testing it on a new town.
				</p>

				<p>
					The steps of creating the graph, calculating the fastest route, and calculating the optimal route are repeated for Town 2.
				</p>

				<p>
					As previously, the route calculated takes into account the distance and risk of each road, and the risk multipliers can be adjusted to prioritise speed or safety.
